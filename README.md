PRODIGY-TASK-04 - üî¢ Sudoku Solver (Python)
This program automatically solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using backtracking, a classic recursive algorithm. It takes an input grid with empty cells (represented by 0s) and fills in the missing numbers while ensuring all Sudoku rules are followed.

üõ†Ô∏è Features

 - Automatically solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
 - Uses recursive backtracking to try all possibilities efficiently
 - Validates each move according to Sudoku constraints
 -  Fast and logical solution finding, not brute-force
 -  Prints the completed grid in a readable format
 -  Easy to modify for visual output or GUI

üß† Concepts Demonstrated
 - 2D array manipulation
 - Backtracking algorithm (recursive trial and error)
 - Constraint checking: ensures no duplicates in rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids
 - Loops and recursion for exploring number placements
 - Clean, modular code with helper functions

üíª Sample Input Grid

grid = [
  [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
  [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]
