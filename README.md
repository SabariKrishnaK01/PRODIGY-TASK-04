PRODIGY-TASK-04 - üî¢ Sudoku Solver (Python)
This program automatically solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using backtracking, a classic recursive algorithm. It takes an input grid with empty cells (represented by 0s) and fills in the missing numbers while ensuring all Sudoku rules are followed.

üõ†Ô∏è Features

 - Automatically solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
 - Uses recursive backtracking to try all possibilities efficiently
 - Validates each move according to Sudoku constraints
 -  Fast and logical solution finding, not brute-force
 -  Prints the completed grid in a readable format
 -  Easy to modify for visual output or GUI

üß† Concepts Demonstrated
 - 2D array manipulation
 - Backtracking algorithm (recursive trial and error)
 - Constraint checking: ensures no duplicates in rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids
 - Loops and recursion for exploring number placements
 - Clean, modular code with helper functions
